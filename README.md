# ansible-useful-playbooks
##I'm trying to put most useful Ansible playbooks in this repository.

1. [insecure-ssh-connection-playbook](enable_ssh_authentication.yml): for any reason sometimes you need to insecure ssh connection (Do not use this play book in Production )
2. [execute-command.yml](execute-command.yml): Execute command and see the result.
